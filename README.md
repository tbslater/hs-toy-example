# Hybrid simulation applied to physical activity policy: a toy example

This repository contains the code for a simplistic hybrid simulation applied to physical activity in children. All simulation was performed in Python. The approach combines

-   Agent-based simulation
-   System dynamics

## Code

-   `agent.py`: for the individual agent
-   `network.py`: for generating agents and forming the friendship network
-   `plot.py`: for running repeats of the simulation and for plotting results
-   `results.ipynb`: results for each scenario tested
-   `sd.py`: for the system dynamics component
-   `simulation.py`: for the hybrid simulation framework
